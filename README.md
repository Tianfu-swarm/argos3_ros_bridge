Recently, I added a new feature: time synchronization.
This enables more precise handling of data based on real-time or simulated timelines. It also allows for accelerated simulation, making it possible to run time-dependent processes faster while maintaining consistency and accuracy across different system components.

With synchronized timing, the system can now:

Align data from multiple sources more accurately

Support high-fidelity simulations

Improve the precision of event tracking and time-based analysis

This upgrade lays the foundation for more advanced processing, particularly in scenarios where time-sensitive interactions are critical.
